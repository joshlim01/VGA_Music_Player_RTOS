### Task 1 ✔️
    Generating a 1 Hz clock from a clock divider for the LFSR
    
    Instantiating a 5-bit LFSR to give us a pseudo-random bit sequence

### Task 2 ✔️
    Instantiating the DDS module

### Task 3 ✔️
    Modulating the DDS using the LFSR using bit 0 of the LFSR

    Generating the ASK (OOS), BPSK, and LFSR signals
    
### Task 4 ✔️
    Connecting the signals to the VGA oscilloscope

### Task 5 ✔️
    Generating the FSK signal using PIOs in Qsys and Nios

### Task 6 ✔️
    Adding Nios PIOs, GUI buttons, and software to change the colors of the graphs upon command

### Task 7 ✔️
    Implementing the QPSK modulation and show it in the VGA oscilloscope

Read up more on QPSK here - https://www.ece.unb.ca/tervo/ece4253/qpsk.shtml

### Task 8 ✔️
    Enabling audio and adding 3 songs to the music player

    Adding a 'PREV' and 'NEXT' button in the GUI to navigate between songs like a radio.

Tracklist:
1. Immortals - Fall Out Boy
2. Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High? - Arctic Monkeys
3. Golden Brown - The Stranglers
